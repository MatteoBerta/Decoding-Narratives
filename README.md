**Decoding Narratives: Towards a Classification Analysis for Stereotypical Patterns in Italian News Headlines**

**ABSTRACT**

Media headlines shape our initial interpretation of news, framing narratives that influence societal engagement with political and social issues. Yet, they often rely on sensationalism and bias to capture readers' attention.

In this paper, we aim to uncover distinct patterns in Italian headline composition, examining how language and framing vary across political leanings. By comparing two of the most relevant newspapers in Italy, anonymized as Newspaper A and Newspaper B, we aim to uncover subtle but impactful differences in information presentation. To achieve this, we analyzed a dataset of daily Italian newspaper articles from two outlets with opposing political perspectives, focusing on a subset of topics ($n=8$) likely to contain stereotypes or clickbait headlines. Our approach involves (1) training an accurate deep learning classifier ($F1=0.84$) to learn specific patterns for categorizing headlines into these two perspectives, and (2) leveraging Explainable AI techniques to extract and interpret the learned patterns.

Our analysis reveals distinct tonal differences between the two newspapers: Newspaper A generally adopts a more balanced and nuanced approach, while Newspaper B often favors a more direct and sometimes provocative style, especially regarding topics like immigration and social justice. Additionally, Newspaper Bâ€™s headlines tend to be brief and punchy, in contrast to the longer, more detailed headlines typically found in Newspaper A.
