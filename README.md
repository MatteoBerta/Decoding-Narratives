This work analyzes how Italian newspapers with opposing political leanings differ in their headline composition, particularly regarding stereotypical or clickbait content. Using a deep learning classifier and Explainable AI, the study highlights tonal distinctions: Newspaper A is more balanced and detailed, while Newspaper B is punchier and more provocative, especially on sensitive topics like immigration and social justice.
