This repository contains the source code of the paper [Decoding Narratives: Towards a Classification Analysis for Stereotypical Patterns in Italian News Headlines](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10825258) presented at the **DS4EIW Workshop, IEEE BigData 2024**


This work analyzes how Italian newspapers with opposing political leanings differ in their headline composition, particularly regarding stereotypical or clickbait content. Using a deep learning classifier and Explainable AI, the study highlights tonal distinctions: Newspaper A is more balanced and detailed, while Newspaper B is punchier and more provocative, especially on sensitive topics like immigration and social justice.

The pipeline followed for this analysis is the following:
